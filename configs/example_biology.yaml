  experimental_methods:
    definition: 'Experimental Methods: a paper that introduces, explains, or significantly
      refines experimental techniques, protocols, laboratory methods, or biological
      assays, providing detailed descriptions and validations to improve accuracy,
      reproducibility, or insight in biological research.'
    node_definition: Types of experimental techniques, protocols, laboratory procedures,
      or biological assays introduced or significantly refined, detailing their design,
      validation, and implementation to improve accuracy, reproducibility, or effectiveness
      in biological research.
  datasets:
    definition: 'Datasets: a paper that introduces new biological datasets (e.g.,
      genomic sequences, imaging data, ecological observations), detailing their generation,
      structure, annotation, and intended use, and provides initial analyses or benchmarks
      demonstrating their value in addressing gaps or enabling new biological insights.'
    node_definition: Types of biological datasets introduced (e.g., genomic, proteomic,
      imaging, ecological data), describing their creation, structure, annotation,
      and intended use, accompanied by initial analyses or benchmarks demonstrating
      their utility in enabling novel insights or addressing research gaps.
  theoretical_advances:
    definition: 'Theoretical Advances: a paper that proposes new biological theories,
      models, frameworks, or conceptual insights, supported by rigorous analysis,
      modeling, or experimental validation, aimed at improving fundamental understanding
      of biological systems.'
    node_definition: Types of new biological theories, conceptual frameworks, or models
      proposed, supported by rigorous analytical, mathematical, or empirical validation,
      aimed at enhancing fundamental understanding of biological systems or phenomena.
  applications:
    definition: 'Applications: a paper which demonstrates practical use of biological
      knowledge or techniques to address real-world problems in domains such as biomedicine
      (therapies, diagnostics, drug development), agriculture (crop improvement, pest
      control), or conservation (species protection, ecosystem management), focusing
      on practical impact and applied outcomes.'
    node_definition: Types of practical applications of biological research or techniques
      in domains such as biomedicine (therapeutics, diagnostics), agriculture (crop
      improvement, pest management), or conservation biology (species protection, ecosystem
      management), emphasizing real-world impact, feasibility, and applied outcomes.
  evaluation_methods:
    definition: 'Evaluation Methods: a paper which systematically evaluates biological
      techniques, datasets, or computational methods, using benchmarking, comparative
      analyses, or novel evaluation metrics, to provide deeper insights into their
      effectiveness, limitations, or biases, thereby enhancing understanding and guiding
      future research.'
    node_definition: Types of systematic approaches for evaluating biological methods,
      datasets, or computational techniques through benchmarking, comparative analysis,
      or novel performance metrics, aimed at identifying strengths, weaknesses, biases,
      or effectiveness, thus informing and guiding future research directions.
